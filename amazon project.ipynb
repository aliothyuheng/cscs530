      "1. State the problem or question you are addressing in a single sentence.\n",
      "This project is intended to learn in which way a customer may be affected by the recommendation system provided by the online retailer. (take Amazon as an example)\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Identify why the problem that you are attempting to answer is amenable to an ABM or Networks solution.\n",
      "    1. First, the product construct a undirected network. Each edge stands a co-purchase relation and the number of co-purchase represent the potential of this edge. Evaluation the co-purchase network is a network problem.\n",
      "    2. Each customer is an agent and will enter this network and their bahavior will affect the network and also affect other agents' behavior. This is a ABM problem    \n",
      "    \n",
      "3. Outline, at a high level, how you will use your model to evaluate your question and the various pieces of your model.  Identify a mechanism or process, how you will perform an experiment with its parameters, and what you will measure.\n",
      "There are three questions need to be answer in this model:\n",
      "\n",
      "a. How different recommendation network will affect a customer(agent)'s shopping behavior.\n",
      "    1. I will first fix the parameter of an agent and tune the parameter of the network. For each network, I will record the purchase choice of the customer initiated by every single product of the network.  \n",
      "    2. I will then compare the purchase records and see how the change in according to the network parameter change.\n",
      "    3. I will then change the angent's parameter and repeat the steps above to see whether the influence differs between different customer groups.\n",
      "b. How different customers will affect the network construction\n",
      "    1. In this step, I will fix the parameter of a customer to a specific range. I will then randomly generate customer based on the parameter ranges chosen. Customers enter the network one by one and the network structure is recorded.\n",
      "    2. The number of cumstomers entered the network will be recorded and the network structure(the edge and node) will be recorded to see how the network change in according to the customer number.\n",
      "    3. I will then change the parameter setting of the customer and repeat the steps above to see how different customer will affect the network.\n",
